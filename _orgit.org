Do you worry how current media and
trust in information will desolve?
Do these questions keep you up at night,
like me?

After the age of information?
Will come a golden age?
Of growth?

What is the terrain for digital growth?

* I am Dr. Gregor Kappler and
offer you my professional perspective on the
current digital disruptions:
For decades I observed as a data scientist
the building of index systems
for agencies and corporations.
For decades I studied neural networks and
understood measurement is mathematic bundling,
centrally factoring.
For decades I researched how to formalize
decentralized understanding of data.

What is the

** Social Media
has produced great social dumbness.

** Artificial Intelligence
is taken over social affairs.

** Why?
*** Social Media controls processes
- standards for data exchange,
- legal frameworks for intellectual property,
- expert fact checking for weeding out "disinformation"
  
*** Artificial Intelligence controls capacity
- big training data storage
- big models cluster computation
- mathematical understanding

*** Control and regulation are centralized!
* FERTIG Today \rightarrow Utopia?
Hero of life,
*next steps*
define your path.

** to your sustainable equity?
1. stare at 📰 news in fear
2. feed social media your thoughts
3. trust the experts
4. consume your equity

*** What is the information flow?
*Messages and behavior* flow from we the people
through Telcos and Media
to Corporations and various agencies.

In turn we the people get delivered *trusted information.*

We see distrust between neighbors and privacy laws protecting us from each other's stalking.

Information flow defines perception
and thus the trust in experts and in science.

The center is towering seeing and explaining all.

**** How much is society a machine?
With people as input,
and policy as output?

Computing control from biggest data,
with predictive processings,
most expensive.


*** Are you destined to be 
**** *informed* by the best?
by worrying news,
feel stress induced.
Sickening fear porn.

See illness, feel repulsion,
your human relations disintegrate.
Burn in your anger
feel the hot blames
that explode between groups.
**** *entertained* by the best?
in super-hero phantasy
co-loving idols
in drama, thriller and porn?

**** *observed* through social media?
Confess your personal expression.
You whisper into the unknown,
this screen is the black hole.
This strong gravitational center.
See humanity falling besides you,
whispering into screens.
Blind to resonance.
Illuminating ourselved -- to the machine.
To strange judgement, collective shit-storms, banning, and censorship.

Social media observes
minds blown.
**** *lead* by the best?
You can follow the science.
You can trust in esteemed experts.
Experts have benevolent intentions,
designing the great rescue.

The experts protect you
from crazies, lies and
malevolent conspiracy theorists.

**** *measured* by experts?
Consume sustainably
and be fairly integrated
into a technocratic society.
You will evolve
into a just world,
"you will own nothing
and you will be happy."

The great reset is 
the social nirvana!
Finally be consumed.
Vaccines are love!

A question:
What is the measure
of a human soul?
In resource it's finite.
** to your freedom in peace?
I teach myself:
1. Don't stare at 📰 news in fear!
   *Sit still* and appreciate pieces of art in peace!
2. Don't feed social media your thoughts!
   *Express* your thoughts!
3. Don't trust the experts!
   *Discern* your mistaken thinking!
4. Don't consume your equity!
   *Share your gifts* finding balance!

*** I rather deny that passive destiny above and instead actively
**** *understand* naturally connections?
Instead of being *informed* I aim to sit in silence,
Stopping confusion,
Appreciating peacefully
the freedom of thinking.

I find beauty
Read and aquire a taste.
Old classics are a good start.
**** *appreciate* beauty?
Instead of being *entertained* I aim to entrust attention to beauty.
I want to learn from it,
build 
maybe gain beauty.
I find beauty in chains of thought
and long measured arguments.

I better shun attention addiction.
**** *express* with refined love?
You feed yourself
as you starve social media.
You imagine your own ideas and
will find your kind and art.

Anyways we do
decentrally consider
We discern
calmly and fairly and measured,
each any every one on its own.
We connect and consolidate
many strifes
for enlightenment.


**** *decide* on opportunity?
All will balance expressions,
will ask, select and listen.
Crypto-currency can pay
for good contributions.
We must check radicle ethereum and lbry.

Econonmy and value can naturally reset
when we balance by rules
of symbiosis:
good contributions get well fed,
and parasites?
are starved and then excreted.

**** *contribute* in gratitude?
You can offer and share
those expressions that feel most urgent.
Value, enthusiasm, joy, pride.

I better name the emotions
of urgency and repression.
I better shun self-censorship.
I better keep for myself,
I better contribute habitually.
** You, hero of life, your next steps define your destiny.
I suggest: write for your life!
Archive for your life!
Consolidate for your life!
It's time for the collective consolidation of trust
against this deception shit!

How?
Together!
Simple and incluse.
You do you, i do me, we do us - diverse we resist the centralization.

** TODO Let's disrupt social media.
We simply must do it,
and by simple means.

You and I
we start today.

We have long learned most we need:
Writing, and consolidating information.

We need not to wait.

We need no new platforms,
we need to decentrally distribute.

We have all the tools that we need
to write our message.
Why not start today?

is a beautiful rule-set for organizing group collaboration,
successful for decades,
with solidly worked out materials.

** 🏹 What do we aim for?
Big question!
Is there one answer?
Many aim for understanding what works.
Obviously.

Understanding what works...
*** ⚒ What "works"?

**** All language is magic:
we work the world with spells.
With looks or tongue or writing.

**** Black magic
moves the living on illusions, with seduction and incantations of death
and fear!!

**** White magic
is seeing through  into clarity,
sees techniques and possibilities and
builds worlds.
Mathematics: Probability Theory and Programming!

*** Analysis and suggestion must "work"!
In the sense that they move information into clarity,
as economical as possible,
as distributed as possible,
  - because there is lot's to do.
As far into formal proofs (mathematical proofs)
  - as possible.
As far into runnable programs
  - as possible.
** You can learn new habits and powerful tools.
This Screen Recording shows how I write in the mycelium.

We also can use OrGitBots for Telegram chatting.

All software I recommend is open source!
- orgmode :: is the markup format you see me writing here.
  
- emacs :: the mother of all editors (MOAE, optional!!! powerful!!! Tough cookie to learn)
  alternatively any text editor will do...
  We want decentral independence from tools!!
  (request tutorials? Windows Notepad++, Atom)
  
- git :: decentral versioning and collaborative text editing.
  Specifically *magit* in emacs.

This brief introductory tutorial is the
first streaming of my working with
1. information: notes, texts and
2. collaborative decentral versioning.

*** GNU emacs
The mother of all editors!
by Richard Stallman

⌨  all keyboard
🖱 no mouse

*No menues*: less confusion.
It is important to 👀 focus when you write.
No distractions any more.
None!

Key binding shortcuts
=M-x=   : elisp commands (Alt-x, say "meta x")
=C-h i= : Info on emacs


Lots to learn.
Steep learning curve.
Very good investment.

Learn from the info pages.
They are well written.

*** Control computers with language!
If you know only Windows, you are used to control you computer with the mouse.
Eben Moglen (great guy - involved in GPL3!!): mouse = "the *caveman* interface: you point and you grunt"
I think Eben is dishonoring our caveman ancestors - they spoke a lot! - otherwise Eben is spot on!
mouse = "the *infant* interface: you point and you grunt!"

Calm down and relax. Controling with text is a journey you are invited to - but it is not a requirement.
It is my way to work.
It is a way for many people loving language, and formal languages.

I will record my introductions and tutorials
on the information mycelium using my software.
I do me, you do you!!
Maybe it will be inspiration to learn emacs,
  - maybe not.
Emacs is not a requirement!
(but it allows these fancy things like collapsing headlines ;-))

Before we look into the ideas of the mycelium, let me explain and show git a bit ;-)

I use Magit (emacs again): not a requirement, but just lovely.

What the F*ck happened?
- we staged changes (this file and the =.gitignore= file for ignoring emacs backup files)
  Staging files can be done without magit in the terminal:
  #+begin_src sh
  git add _orgit.org
  #+end_src
- we committed changes with a comment (an initial version)
  In the terminal:
  #+begin_src sh
  git commit -m "a note describing the changes"
  #+end_src
- We looked at the log of this "commit"

As long as you work on your own that is all you need to know.

is *the* central place for many git repositories - with a long history (today developed & owned by microsoft).
Most github repositories are programming - but never mind.

(this is literate shell programming:)

git remote add origin git@github.com:gkappler/InformationMycelium.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
#+end_src

So, it is this easy to publish your text files with emacs.
Well "publish" on GitHub as a repository, crude and ugly.

We will go further and pretty, I do hope!
Together, I do hope!

Let me conclude and repeat what we learned --

your life in plain text.

I started using org in about 2009.
I never left again.
Wrote
- my private notes & plans
- scientific papers
- slides
- mails

I got addicted, and needed to learn how to consciously forget.
Now I hope I can share my love.

Org changed my writing.
It helped me focus.
** Org influenced my view on texts as a forest:
*** org started as a better outline mode by [[http://google.at/?q=Carsten Dominik&hl=en&as_vis=1&as_sdt=2001&as_sdtp=on][Carsten Dominik]].
And so it is no surprise org is powerful for mathematics, and programming and science.

*** outline means sub-headlines
*** A file forms a tree of sections/headlines
*** A forest consists of many trees
and all the life that lives on and between those trees.

** Org allows to markup and format

You really can write nearly everything in org.
But you will need emacs for a full experience.

With org and git, a huge forest of texts is formally defined.
This forest is shared between us, and can be used for organizing basically anything as a group.

It is all text, right?
It is all sequences of symbols.

Text can be collaboratively written with =git=.
And shared on github.
